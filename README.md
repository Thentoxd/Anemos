Anemos offers a range of features and tools to make your Minecraft network management easier and more efficient. One of the most notable features of Anemos is its customizable player routing system, which allows you to set up complex routing rules that determine how players move between servers based on various factors such as player count, server load, and player permissions.

Anemos also offers advanced tools for managing permissions, chat, and player data across your network. You can easily set up custom permissions and group management systems, control chat filters and anti-spam measures, and access detailed player data and analytics to help you optimize your network's performance.
